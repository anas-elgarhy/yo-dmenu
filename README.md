# My awesome fork from [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu) 🍴♥
> With a lot of beautiful patches and some of my own.

## Patches
- [highlight](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/highlight) - This patch highlights the individual characters of matched text for each dmenu list entry.
- [case-insensitive](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/case-insensitive) - This patch changes case-insensitive item matching to default behaviour. Adds an -s option to enable case-sensitive matching.
- [center](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/center) - This patch centers dmenu in the middle of the screen.
- [grid](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/grid) - This patch allows you to render dmenu's entries in a grid by adding a new -g flag to specify the number of grid columns. You can use -g and -l together to create a G columns * L lines grid.
